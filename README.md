# Created-credit-risk-model

This paper aims to reveal the top credit risk factors for the technology sector using principal component 
analysis. Viewing these as the input parameters, we propose a credit risk model based on logistic regression 
that is tailored to the technology companies worldwide. In particular, this model would take in data for an 
equal number of technology companies that survived and defaulted during the dotcom bubble during a 
period of one to two years before they defaulted in 2001. This model would serve as a complementary credit 
risk tool on top of the widely used Altman z-score. Furthermore, the study is expected to analyse the current 
credit standing for the technology firms in the recent decade, therefore offering advice to these technology 
firms, investors, and policymakers from a credit risk perspective.
